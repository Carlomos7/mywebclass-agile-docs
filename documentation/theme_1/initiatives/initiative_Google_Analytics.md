# Implement Google Analytics

## Description:
In order to better understand website traffic, user behavior, and engagement metrics, we need to implement Google 
Analytics on our website. Google Analytics is a powerful tool that will allow us to track user activity, such as 
pageviews, session duration, bounce rates, and more. By having access to this data, we can make informed decisions about
website design, content, and marketing strategies.

## Goals:
* Gain a better understanding of website traffic patterns and user behavior
* Identify opportunities for website optimization and improvement
* Make informed decisions about website design and content
* Improve website user experience and engagement

## Scope:  
Implement Google Analytics tracking code across all pages of the website. This includes defining and configuring custom
tracking metrics and dimensions, setting up conversion tracking and funnels, and establishing goals and alerts. 
Additionally, configuring and customizing reports and providing team training on how to interpret and use Google 
Analytics data are within the scope of this initiative.

## Outcomes: 
* Gain insights into website traffic, user behavior, and engagement metrics
* Identify areas for improvement and optimization
* Improve website user experience and engagement
* Use data to inform decision-making about website design and content

## Deliverables:
* Google Analytics tracking code implemented on all pages of the website
* Custom tracking metrics and dimensions defined and configured
* Conversion tracking and funnels configured
* Goals and alerts configured
* Customized reports configured and available to the team
* Team trained on how to interpret and use Google Analytics data

## Milestones:
* Google Analytics tracking code implemented on website (1 week)
* Custom tracking metrics and dimensions defined and configured (2 weeks)
* Conversion tracking and funnels configured (3 weeks)
* Goals and alerts configured (4 weeks)
* Customized reports configured and available to the team (5 weeks)
* Team trained on how to interpret and use Google Analytics data (6 weeks)

## Constraints:
* Website design and layout cannot be significantly altered
* Limited budget for Google Analytics premium features

## Assumptions:
* Website traffic will increase as a result of improved website engagement and user experience
* The team will be able to effectively interpret and use Google Analytics data to inform decision-making

## Risks: 
* Implementation could impact website performance
* Lack of team buy-in could lead to limited use of Google Analytics data
* Limited budget could restrict access to important Google Analytics features

## Dependencies:
* Website hosting and infrastructure must be stable and secure
* Website content and design must remain consistent during implementation
* All team members must have access to and be trained on how to use Google Analytics

## Team: 
* Marketing team
